# LGC
Large Glider Collider project

Read LGC.ipynb for more information about the project.

To compile the program, while in `/build` directory run `cmake .`, then follow with `cmake build .`.

This will create two programs in the `/bin` directory - one named `Rules` to show how does the simulation look with a certain rule. The other `LGC` is the main program and currently using basic pseudorandomness looks for backgrounds within a selected rule.
